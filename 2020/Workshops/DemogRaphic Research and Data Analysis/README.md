# Introduction

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce participants to demographic research and data analysis using R. As you may have already known, R is a powerful, cross-platform, open-source, and **free** software that has been widely adopted across a number of [social]science fields. We will attempt to cover the basics of demographic methods and data analysis in R. The session will focus on laying a groundwork to enable future self-teaching of specific use cases *[models, packages, analysis]*. A number of platforms provide *free* training resources for learning R online. This includes but not limited to *[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)*, *[edX](https://www.edx.org/)*, *[Cousera](https://www.coursera.org/)*, *[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)*, and of course *[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)*, 


For the session, you will be required to have R and Rstudio installed on your computer. If you are still to download/install R [[click here](https://cloud.r-project.org/)] or [[here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)] to download RStudio
