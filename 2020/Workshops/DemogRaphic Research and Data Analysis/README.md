# Introduction

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce participants to demographic research and data analysis using R. As you may have already known, R is a powerful, cross-platform, open-source, and **free** software that has been widely adopted across a number of [social]science fields. We will attempt to cover the basics of demographic methods and data analysis in R. The session will focus on laying a groundwork to enable future self-teaching of specific use cases *[models, packages, analysis]*. A number of platforms provide *free* training resources for learning R online. This includes but not limited to *[edX](https://www.edx.org/)*, *[Cousera](https://www.coursera.org/)*, *[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)*, and of course *[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)*, 


For the session, you will be required to have R and Rstudio installed on your computer. If you are still to download/install R [[click here](https://cloud.r-project.org/)] or [[here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)] to download RStudio

# About Me

Hi, I am Emmanuel Ọlámíjùwón. I teach undergraduate courses in Demography at the University of Eswatini in Eswatini, and I'm a PhD candidate in Demography and Population Studies at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. I have been hooked on R since 2017 when I attended the IUSSP training workshop on social media, big data and digital demography in Cape Town. I have since participated in several workshops including the Summer Institute for Computational Social Science [[SICSS 2018](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2018/capetown/)], and the BaRcelona Summer School of Demography [[BSSD](https://ced.uab.cat/en/courses/barcelona-summer-school-of-demography/)] in 2019. The BSSD is accepting applications to attend the 2020 summer school until 31 March, 2020. Details of the summer school, as well as the modules can be found [[here](https://ced.uab.cat/en/courses/barcelona-summer-school-of-demography/)].


<img align="centre" src="Data - Misc/googling.jpg">


I also attended the Rostock Open Science Workshop in 2019, SatRday South Africa and I was a teaching assistant for [SICSS 2019](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2019/capetown/). I have also been a co-organizer of the [Eswatini UseR Group](https://www.meetup.com/EswatiniUseR/) for building local capacity for data analysis using R in Eswatini since 2019. Recently, I developed a ShinyApplication [[African DT ProfileR](https://eolamijuwon.shinyapps.io/AfricanDTprofileR/)] for visualizing demographic transitions in African countries. Most of the time, I use data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), but recently, I have been using data from online sources such as surveys and social media platforms. For example, my doctoral research is examining opportunities for advancing sexual and reproductive health information for young African adults using [digital trace data](https://cbail.github.io/SICSS_what_is_digital.html).
